[h1]A Hardcore Survival World.[/h1]

This was created for me and friends to be able to have fun in Space Engineers while having a challenging experience.
You start on Omicron and the goal of the game is to hop to every planet until you get to either Paradise or the Medieval planets.

[b]All the mods listed to the right that are set as required items, are required as there will be issues loading the save.[/b]

If you join this world you'll notice the planets are larger than normal, that is because I used a plugin to change the planet size. This plugin will work in single player and most likely on a server too. The guide for this plugin is here:
