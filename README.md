Doing The Impossible
---

## A Hardcore Survival World.

This was created for me and friends to be able to have fun in Space Engineers while having a challenging experience.   
You start on Omicron and the goal of the game is to hop to every planet until you get to either Paradise or the Medieval planets.   

**All the mods listed to the right that are set as required items, are required as there will be issues loading the save**

If you join this world you'll notice the planets are larger than normal, that is because I used a plugin to change the planet size. This plugin will work in single player and most likely on a server too. The guide for this plugin is here:

**Credit:** To all the mod authors who have I have used their mods in this workshop and "balls" on Discord for the planet size plugin, and my boyfriend who has been very supportive to me.
